This was my LDJAM entry for Ludum Dare #38. For details on the
development of the game, please read the [Post
Mortem](http://makenai.net/Ludum-Dare-38-Postmortem/).

You were sitting in your living room, playing a video game and minding
your own business until you accidentally ate a RADIOACTIVE CHEETO. Now
you are 500 feet tall and must get out of the city while causing as
little carnage as possible.

**OPT OUTS:** I am opting out of graphics, sound and music as they were
either from opengameart or randomly generated.

This is my first ldjam, and first game in probably 15 years or so. I've
made this using Phaser as I am a JavaScript developer for my normal day
job and it seemed smart go with what I know! Other tools used: Tiled,
Aseprite, bfxr, Wolfram Tones, Texture Packer, and Photoshop.
